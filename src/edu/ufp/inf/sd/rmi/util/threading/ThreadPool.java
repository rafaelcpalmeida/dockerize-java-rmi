/**
 * When task creation frequency is high and mean task duration is low
 * use thread pool instead of creating a new thread for each request.
 * 
 * The thread pool size depends on the number of available processors (N)
 * and the nature of the tasks.
 * i) For compute-bounded tasks:
 *      => Thread pool size = N or N+1 threads.
 * ii) For tasks that wait for I/O to complete:
 *      => Thread pool size = N*(1+WT/ST).
 * Use profiling to determine WT (mean waiting time) and ST (mean service time).
